# EVS-Electronic-Voting-System-
## My team Project for Pf lab.
### “Our team project is an Electronic Voting System in C. This system aims to make the voting process more efficient and secure by digitizing it, with a user-friendly interface for both administrators and voters. The admin can easily manage data, set up the voting session, and maintain security by saving passwords in an encrypted format. We use XOR and other operations on the encryption key to ensure that stored data remains protected and difficult to crack.
Voters can securely log in, cast their votes, and have their selections saved in organized files, which helps. with accurate result management. We chose this project because traditional voting methods often encounter issues like manual errors and delays. By automating and securing the process, this electronic voting system can help address these challenges, making it a timely and relevant solution today. “
